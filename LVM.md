Logical volume manager (LVM) introduces an extra layer between the physical disks and the file system allowing file systems to be :
– resized and moved easily and online without requiring a system-wide outage.
– Using discontinuous space on disk
– meaningful names to volumes, rather than the usual cryptic device names.
– span multiple physical disks

LVM comprises of few conceptual layers such as physical volume, logical volume and file systems.
