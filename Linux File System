Linux File System:
In Linux, all the filesystems are part of a single directory tree. The main file system is referred to as root (/) filesystem. 

Following are the important and basic commands were taught during the training:

1. pwd: This command tells us about the present working directory. This gives the complete path of the current working directory.
        ex: $ pwd  
            /home/user     (Output)
   
2. cd: cd stands for change directory. This command is used to change the current working directory.
        ex: $ cd dir
             /home/user/dir    (This will be new working directory)
             
3. touch: This command creates new empty file in the current working directory.
        ex: $touch file.txt
          
4. cat: cat is short for concatenate. This command can be used to show and create files. Also some input can be appended at the end of the file using this command.
        ex: cat file.txt  (This will show the contents of file.txt file)
            cat > file.txt (This will create a new file with name file.txt)
            cat >> file.txt
            Hello World!!    (Hello World!! will get appended at the end of the file)
            
 5. df : df stands for disk filesystem. It is used to display disk space used in the filesystem.
         ex: df    (shows disk space used in the filesystem.)
